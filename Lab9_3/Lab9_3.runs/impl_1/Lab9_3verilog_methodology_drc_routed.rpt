2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin FSM_sequential_state_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
